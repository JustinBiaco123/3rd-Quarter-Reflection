Personally, this quarter has been really fun, exiciting and also challenging. I can say that I learned a lot of new stuff which can hugely help me in my future career. At first, I was nervous but also excited, because I discovered that we would be tackling Javascript for this quarter, and I know it wasn't gonna be easy. I learned the background information and some important concept in Javascript like Javascript's syntax guides, variables, operators, functions, properties and methods of javascript and where you can insert javascript in your website. I also learned some simple coding in Javascript like concatenation, table, popup button and displaying simple texts. I did not expect my grade to be that high again this quarter since I feel like I failed the summative and the quizzes, maybe the hands-on pulled my grades up since my friend and I practiced it at school (me and Ralph). </p>

Overall, this quarter has been really fun since I learned another programming language (even if we're still in the simple part) and I managed to survive another quarter. To end, I would like to thank you Ms. Uminga for being a great teacher to us, I also thank God for giving me blessings and knowledge everyday and my family and friends for always supporting me.
